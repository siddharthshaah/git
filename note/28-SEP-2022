What are the lifecycle status in which a File can exists in Git Repository?
A file can exist in Git repository in one of the four statuses
1. untracked = an newly created file which is not added to the repository will be in untracked status
2. modified  = when we edited an existing file of the repository, then it will moved to modified status
3. unmodified = a commited file will be moved to unmodified status
4. staged = files that are modified, are made ready for commit are called staged

let us explore the commands to move the files across the lifecycle status in repository.
	
1. create a new repository
create an empty directory
mkdir projectdir
cd projectdir
git init = initializes an empty repository in the directory under where we executed

2. how to see the status of the repository
git status
shows status of all the files in the repository like untracked, modified and staged.
	
How does the git repository captures the author information who is commiting the files into the repository?
There are 2 levels at which we can configure the author info to capture the commit history
1. repository level
2. global

#1. repository level
for a specific repository we can configure user & email who is commiting the files using the below commands
git config user.name username
git config user.email emailAddress

the information about the repository will be kept under .git/config file


#2. global system level
git config --global user.name username
git config --global user.email emailAddress

The global configuration is stored in ~/.gitconfig file

How to remove the user.name or user.email that we set globally?
git config --global --unset-all user.name
git config --global --unset-all user.email

for repository level dont use --global switch
	
	
#3. 
git add . = will stage all the untracked and modified files in the repository
git add filename = to stage only a specific file of the repository
git add -u = will stage all the modified files only

#4. how to see all the commits made into the repository
git log = shows all the commits to the repository in a chronological ascending order

#5 
How to rollback the changes in a modified file which is not yet staged?
(or)
How to discard the changes made in a repo file?	
(unmodified)-> edited -> modified -> goback to unmodified
git restore pathtoFile
for eg.. git restore lunch-menu.txt
will rollback all the changes made inside the file into the repository version

#6.
repositoryFile -> edited -> modified -> staged
(unmodified)
git restore --staged filename
with the above command the file will be unstaged, but the modifications we made still exists in the File

#7. 
untracked -> staged = moveback to untracked state
There are mutliple commands using which we can move an staged file back to untracked status
1. git restore --staged filename.txt
2. git rm --cached filename = we are asking git to remove the file from cached (staged status), which is unstage it
            |
				 staged


#8.
How to remove a commited change into repository
git reset --hard commithash
