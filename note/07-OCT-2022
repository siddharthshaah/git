How to work with branches in git repository?
by default when we create an repository using git init, an empty repository is created with a default branch as "master". 
we can create a new branch from the existing branch using

1. git branch branchname = a new branch from the current branch we are in
or
git checkout -b branchname



2. we can see all the branches within the repository using 
git branch
this returns all the branches in the repository by showing "*" indicating the current branch you are in
